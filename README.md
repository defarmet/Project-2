This is a group project meant to show "full stack" development utilizing MySql. It also had to incorporate a new technology which was pasport.js, use handlebars, have both GET and POST routes, have a MVC folder structure, and finally incorporate sequilize as the ORM.  Our group of three contributors chose to make a site called "Kidzread" to allow kids and parents to log in and log a books that they had read and make the process personal and fun. The product is a functional site that allows the parent to log in and then create an account for the child. From there they are directed to a personal page allowing them to log books and have them reflected on their personal page. There is also a search feature that connects to Goodreads but because of an outdated XML format, does not display in a user freindly manner. The final product was deployed on Heroku as per instructions.
